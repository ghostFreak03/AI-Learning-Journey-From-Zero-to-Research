# AI Learning Journey 🤖 - From Zero to Research 👨🏻‍🔬

This repository is a public record of an Android engineer's journey to becoming an AI Research Engineer/Scientist over the next few years. Documenting everything I learn from books, projects, and experiments.
I'm starting from scratch and aiming to build strong foundations in Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Current Book: Grokking Deep Learning – Andrew Trask

### Progress Log
```Aug 8 - 2025```
- Started with **Grokking Deep Learning** by Andrew Trask
    - 📂 [Notes & Code](./books/grokking-deep-learning)

## Goals
- Build strong foundations in Deep Learning and AI
- Move from beginner → independent research in 3–4 years
- Apply knowledge in open-source projects & research papers
- Work on LLM research (e.g., Meta’s LLaMA, GPT-like models)

#### Note - Learning in public means mistakes will happen, and I will update my notes as I correct them.
